# 🌐 Agile Web Foundations Project

This project is a multi-page interactive web application developed as part of the **CITS5505 Agile Web Development** unit at The University of Western Australia.

The application demonstrates core front-end development concepts using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with dynamic behaviour implemented using AJAX and browser storage.

## 📌 Project Overview

The website is designed as a learning and assessment platform that guides users through:

1. Learning web development concepts  
2. Testing knowledge via an interactive quiz  
3. Tracking performance over time  
4. Reflecting on AI usage in development  
5. Showcasing a personalised CV  

The application maintains a **consistent design and navigation structure** across all pages, creating a cohesive user experience.
